# Advent Of Code 2022
The AI edition.

This Advent of Code I'm going to start with every problem by using ChatGPT as a starting point.

~I'll have the prompt and the raw output of ChatGPT in one file, and my edited and working solution in another.~

So I've modified it a bit. I'll use ChatGPT to generate functions instead of full code.
Some of the problems are easier to give if you break down the problems into smaller functions for GPT.
