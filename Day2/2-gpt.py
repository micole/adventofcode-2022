Prompt: write a function that calculates a score for rock paper scissors. If you win you get 6 points. If you tie you get 3 points. and if you lose you get 0 points. If you chose rock you get 1 extra point, if you chose paper you get 2 extra points, and if you chose scissors you get 3 extra points.

Response:
Here is a possible solution:
'''
def calculate_score(opponent: str, choice: str) -> int:
    score = 0

    # check for win/loss
    if opponent == choice:
        score = 3
    elif opponent == 'A' and choice == 'B':
        score = 6
    elif opponent == 'B' and choice == 'C':
        score = 6
    elif opponent == 'C' and choice == 'A':
        score = 6

    # add bonus points for choice
    if choice == 'A':
        score += 1
    elif choice == 'B':
        score += 2
    elif choice == 'C':
        score += 3

    return score

'''
This code defines a function calculate_score() that takes two arguments: opponent and choice. These arguments are strings representing the opponent's choice and the player's choice, respectively. The function returns an integer representing the score.

The function first initializes a variable score to 0. Then, it checks if the opponent's choice and the player's choice are the same. If they are, the function sets score to 3, indicating that the player has tied. If the opponent chose rock, paper, or scissors and the player chose the corresponding option that beats it (i.e., paper, scissors, or rock, respectively), the function sets score to 6, indicating that the player has won.

After that, the function checks the player's choice and adds bonus points accordingly. If the player chose rock, it adds 1 point to the score. If the player chose paper, it adds 2 points. And if the player chose scissors, it adds 3 points. Finally, the function returns the total score.

To use this function, you would call it like this:
'''
# opponent chose rock, player chose paper
score = calculate_score('A', 'B')

# opponent chose paper, player chose scissors
score = calculate_score('B', 'C')

# opponent chose scissors, player chose rock
score = calculate_score('C', 'A')

'''
Note that in this code, the choices are represented using the first letters of the names of the choices (i.e., 'A' for rock, 'B' for paper, and 'C' for scissors). This is just one possible representation; you could use any other representation you prefer (e.g., 'R' for rock, 'P' for paper, and 'S' for scissors).
